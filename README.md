If you’re up for a challenge, here’s something you might want to check out. We’re running a hacking competition where the first team to break into a Zero Trust system built with G-Gate can take home 30,000 USDT. Yeah, you read that right—30,000 USDT up for grabs, but it’s only for the first successful team. 😈

Here’s the rundown:

🎯 Objective: Get into the Zero Trust system, retrieve the key from the Target.txt file, and be the first to send it in.
🏆 Prize: 30,000 USDT for the first team to crack it.
📺 Watch Live: We’ll be live-streaming the server feed on YouTube for everyone to follow along. Yes, you can strategize while watching!

Quick Rules:

No registration needed—just dive in and attack the environment with the info we provide (IP, MAC, passwords, etc.).
DoS attacks and physical attacks are off-limits, so keep it smart. 🤖

This competition is for security experts, hackers, and anyone with the skills to break through a Zero Trust setup. If you think you’re up for the task, this is your chance to prove it. Plus, who doesn’t want 30,000 USDT?
